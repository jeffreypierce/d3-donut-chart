## D3 Donut Chart
A simple, configurable, animatable chart build with [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/)

#### Usage

```
var donutChart = new DonutChart(selector, [settings])  
donutChart.update(dataSet) 
```

Where `selector` is a id or class of a DOM node, `settings` (optional) is an object of configuration options (see below) and `dataSet` is data values formatted as an array of arrays like this:

```
[['JavaScript', 30], ['C++', 10], ['Ruby', 15], ['Python', 20]]
```
A live example can be viewed [here](http://jeffreypierce.net/d3-donut-chart/)

I based this chart on a tutorial I took a few years back and now forget where it was from. So thanks to the original author of that blog post, whoever you areâ€¦
